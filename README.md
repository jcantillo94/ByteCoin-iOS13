INITIAL BRANCH OWNED BY APPBREWERY, This fork is my modified rendition of the intended format/design pattern and functionality.

# ByteCoin

## Purpose
This app allows users to browse through exchange currency such as USD, AUD, JPY and etc to see what the current exchange rate for Bitcoin is in the currency that they select. The exchange rate given will be the most current exchange rate for Bitcoin provided by coinapi.io.

## What I Learned
- how to retrieve JSON data from API's
- decoding and parsing JSON w/ Swift
- using Delegate design pattern to handle changing properites' values through functions between app components
- defining adopting protocols for delegate design pattern
- creating extenions for the sake of making code design much more legible and adding additional functions into existing classes, structs, etc
